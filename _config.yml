          Technical leadership of Intel\R oneAPI LevelZero Graphics runtime library: Broad scope of work including contributions to LevelZero runtime, specifications, system management, public documentations and product execution.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Staff Graphics SW Engineer
          --------------------------

          - Design and execute graphics runtime interoperability solution for Intel\R GPUs with SYCL, Vulkan, DX12: execution of complex solutions for inter-API resource interoperability and synchronization with zero host overhead used in Blender, Maxon and OIDN for Windows and Linux.       
          - Redesigned from ground up IPC mechanisms for LevelZero runtime library to support multiple devices and multiple processes.
          - Optimized Runtime library that improved GPU submission latency by 4x
          - Led efforts to enable LevelZero runtime to achieve Argonne National Lab's Aurora supercomputer performance goals. This included efforts to improve E2E performance of workloads such as HPL, LAMMPS, QMCPack, HACC, Nekboke.
          
          Senior Software Engineer (HPC Networking)
          -----------------------------------------
          - Efficient multi-threaded newtork performance in Intel\R OPA enabled HPC cluster: Multiple features added to Open MPI, Libfabric and PSM2 libraries to improve performance by 5x allowing up to 95\% BW utilization. Latency improved by 1.5x.
          - Developed framework for full \(100\%\) utilization of Intel\R OPA multiple devices deployed in HPC clusters.
          - Developed process placement algorithms to improve communication patterns when multiple processes are used to drive network traffic. This improved performance for both small and large message sizes with up to 50\% BW improvement and 30\% latency improvement.

        #  I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
